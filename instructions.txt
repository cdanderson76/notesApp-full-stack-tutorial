CONSOLE ERROR


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Now that you're getting the data, store this data in state, and ensure you set the
   rate limitation state to 'false'.

   Ensure you write a block that if the error status is equal to 429, set the rate
   limitation to 'true', otherwise, use react hot toast to produce an error that says 
   'Failed to load notes'.


2. After the 'else' statement, write a 'finally' statement that will set the 'loading'
   state to 'false'.  Open the inspection console, and try to see if the rate limit will
   take effect after 5 tries in 15 seconds.  If you receive the error that you see in
   Anki, you've completed this challenge.

   NOTE: CHANGE BACK TO ORIGINAL TIMING WHEN FINISHED
