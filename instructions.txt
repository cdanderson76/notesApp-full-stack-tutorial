CREATE NOTE


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Complete the 'createNote' function within 'notesController.js' so that notes
   get created and successfully stored in the MongoDB database.  Ensure that:

   if successful: return code 201, and 'Not created successfully' message
   if fails: log 'Error in createNote controller'
   if fails: create 'Internal server error message'
    
   
2. Move the express middleware in 'server.js' before the 'get' route, and 
   test this out creating a note in Postman.  If done successfully, MongoDB, should
   store the note to the MongoDB database.


3. Now, test the 'getAllNotes' route in Postman.  You should be able to see whatever
   note(s) you created.
