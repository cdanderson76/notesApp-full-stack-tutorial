MODEL AND SCHEMA


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Create '/backend/src/models/notes.js'. Create a schema called 'noteSchema'.
   Ensure that it includes a 'title' and 'content'.  These will be required as
   well.  Also, ensure that created and updated actions are kept track of.

   Be sure to export this as well.


2. In 'notesController.js', import the 'Note' model from 'notes.js' turn the   
   'getAllNotes' function into a 'try/catch' with the appropriate error messaging.  
   You are going to have to find the appropriate methods in order to complete the
   functions.

   For 'getAllNotes':

   if successful: status 200
   log 'Error in getAllNotes controller', error
   if fails: status 500 (Internal server error)


3. In 'server.js', sure that all request bodies are read and converted into usable
   format (parsed)  NOTE: THIS IS MIDDLEWARE


   If done correctly, when you go to '/api/notes' you will see an actual empty
   array in the browser like you see in Anki.
