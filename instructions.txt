DELETE FUNCTIONALITY


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Create an async function that will delete the card that you click on.

   NOTE: THE TRASH ICON IS IN A LINK TAG...YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET RID OF THE
         NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR!


2. Use the 'setNotes' setter function in 'HomePage.jsx' to have the UI updated as soon
   as an item is deleted.


3. Create a UI that lets the user know that there aren't any notes to show.  This will
   be called 'NotesNotFound', and you can create this in the 'components' directory.
   use the following boilerplate code to do so:

   Link utility classes: className="btn btn-primary"
   NotebookIcon utility classes: className="size-10 text-primary"

   <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center py-16 space-y-6 max-w-md mx-auto text-center">
      <div className="bg-primary/10 rounded-full p-8">
    
      </div>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold"></h3>
      <p className="text-base-content/70">
        Ready to organize your thoughts? Create your first note to get started on your journey.
      </p>
      
    </div>


4. Construct the UI to look like it does in Anki.  Ensure that there is a link/button
   that will take you to the 'CreatePage', and that there a NotebookIcon that shows
   as well.
