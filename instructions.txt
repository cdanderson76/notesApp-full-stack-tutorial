MONGODB


1. Create the MongoDB database (if you haven't already [there is a file on the
   thumbdrive]).  Create '/backend/.env', and store your connection string of 
   the database there, along with the port number that you will be using for 
   the project.


2. Create a '/backend/config/db.js' file, and create the function
   to connect to the MongoDB database.  Be sure that it's asynchronous and uses
   a 'try/catch' block.  Ensure that the process exits with failure if there is 
   an error.


3. Log that the database has connected ONCE connected.
