DELETE NOTE


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Complete the 'deleteNote' function by using the appropriate method.

   if successful: return code 200, and 'Note deleted successfully' message
   if fails: log 'Error in deleteNote controller'
   if fails: create 'Internal server error message' (error 500);
   
   Account for it the 'ID' for the note is not found/doesn't exist.  Use the
   message 'Note not found' (404).


2. Test this out in Postman.
