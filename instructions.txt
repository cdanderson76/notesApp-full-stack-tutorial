TOAST N TAILWIND


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. In 'main.jsx' import the 'Toaster' from react-hot-toast.  Insert it below the
   'App' within this file.

   Create a button outside of the 'Routes' tag, and have it create a success message
   of 'congrats' just to confirm that it's working.


2. Set up Tailwind CSS (use the 'Tailwind CSS AFTER Vite' file on this thumbdrive).
   Now, update the 'index.css' file with the appropriate syntax.  If this is done
   correctly, you will see the syntax change just a bit.

3. Delete the button that you used to test 'react hot toast'.  Now we are going to 
   install DaisyUI so we don't have to write out so many classes on our own.

   https://v4.daisyui.com/ (not the latest version because it has bugs)
   
   npm install daisyui@4.12.24 -D

   Properly import daisyUI into the 'tailwind.config.js' file


4. Test out daisyUI by creating a button (same as before) by using the following classes:

   btn btn-outline

   Now, grab a set of buttons from daisyui

   If done correctly, the browser will totally change.  Now, use the 'forest' theme from
   daisyui.  Grab a set of buttons from daisyui, and they should look like the first pic
   in Anki.

   Now, change to the 'coffee' theme. The browser should now look like the second pic in
   Anki. Switch back to 'forest' them after verification.
