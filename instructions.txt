START FRONTEND


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Change into the frontend folder, and create your react app with Vite (notes in
   thumbdrive).  Be sure to initialize this under the current folder.
   
   Install the following packages:

   react-router-dom
   react-hot-toast


2. Remove the following:  

   App.css
   The 'assets' folder
   Everything in 'index.css'
   Everything in 'App.jsx'


3. Create boilerplate code for 'App.jsx', rendering 'App' to the browser.  In
   'main.jsx', make it so that you can use routing within the whole application.

   Create '/src/pages', and inside of this directory, create the following components:

   CreatePage.jsx
   HomePage.jsx
   NoteDetailPage.jsx


4. In 'App.jsx' create routes for each component, and verify that they are rendered to the
   browser when navigating to each endpoint.  Endpoints are:

   CreatePage.jsx: /create
   HomePage.jsx: /
   NoteDetailPage: /note/:id
