SPECIFIC NOTE


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Create another route in 'notesRoutes.js', as we are going to create function-
   ionality for grabbing a SPECIFIC note.  We'll call this route 'getNoteById'.
   

2. Create the controller in 'notesController.js'.

   if successful: return code 200, and 'Note deleted successfully' message
   if fails: log 'Error in getNoteById controller'
   if fails: create 'Internal server error message' (error 500);
   
   Account for it the 'ID' for the note is not found/doesn't exist.  Use the
   message 'Note not found' (404).


3. Sort the 'getAllNotes' function in 'notesController.js' so that the new note
   will show first and old notes will show last.  Also, because we are not using
   the 'req' argument in this function, use the proper skip symbol.
