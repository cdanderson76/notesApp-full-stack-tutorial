SHOW NOTES


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Create a component called 'NoteCard.jsx'.  Use the following boilerplate
   code to complete this component:

   <Link to={`/note/${note._id}`}
          className="card bg-base-100 hover:shadow-lg transition-all duration-200 border-t-4 border-solid border-[#00FF9D]">
          <div className="card-body">
            <h3 className="card-title text-base line-clamp-3"></h3>
            <p className="text-base-content/70 line-clamp-3"></p>
            <div className="card-actions justify-between items-center mt-4">
              <span className="text-sm text-base-content/60">
                
              </span>
              <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
                <PenSquareIcon className="size-4" />
                <button className="btn btn-ghost btn-xs text-error">
                  <Trash2Icon className="size-4" />
                </button>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
    </Link>

   You're going to have to use a 'Link' tag that navigates you to the 'NoteDetailPage'
   whenever a note card is clicked.  Also, use the 'PenSquareIcon' and 'Trash2Icon'
   from lucide react to help develop the illustration.

   Import the 'NoteCard.jsx' component into the 'HomePage' component (note, you'll
   have to use the data from the database and iterate over it.



2. Whenever there are notes, we have to show them on the home screen page.  Complete 
   the syntax in order to make this happen.  Use the following boilerplate code
   in order to make this happen:

   CONTAINER FOR THE NOTES (show if there are notes and if there isn't a rate limit:

   <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">
              <div>
                
              </div>
   </div>
