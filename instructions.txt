RATE LIMIT


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Create a database in Upstash, and copy the Redis URL and TOKEN.  Paste these values
   into the '.env' file.

   Now, install the following Upstash packages while in the '/backend' directory:

   npm install @upstash/ratelimit@2.0.5
   npm install @upstash/redis@1.34.9


2. Create '/config/upstash.js', and create a ratelimiter that allows 100 requests per 60
   seconds.


3. Create '/src/middleware/rateLimiter.js', and create an async function called
   'rateLimiter' that will allow you to check for rate-limiting.

   In 'server.js' ensure that you implement the 'rateLimiter' middleware right after the
   Express middlware.  Once completed, test this out in Postman.  You can actually
   change the rate limiter to 5 requests per 10 seconds, and see if it errors out
   after 5 attempts (should look like it does in Anki).

   NOTE: USE THE 'getAllNotes' REQUEST


4. Modify 'server.js' to connect to the MongoDB database and THEN start listening (if it
   doesn't connect to the database, then why should the app start?)
