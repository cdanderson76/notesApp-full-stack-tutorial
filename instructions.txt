CREATE ROUTES


1. Add a 'start' script for deployment (when we want to run the app).  For this we will use
   'node' to start the server.


2. Create the rest of the routes to create, edit, and delete notes with the proper success 
   messages (do this in 'server.js' (the entry point of application).  

   Create '/backend/routes/notesRoutes.js'.  Create Express Router, and store all of the
   endpoints created in 'server.js' in this folder.


3. Create '/backend/controllers/notesController.js'.  Create functions within this file, and 
   further condense the routes in 'notesRoutes.js' into this new file.


4. Create '/backend/src/', and then store the 'controllers' and 'routes' folders within this
   directory.  Fix 'package.json' to reflect the change.  You'll have to stop the running
   server and restart it again
