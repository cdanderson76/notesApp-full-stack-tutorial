CREATE EXPRESS SERVER


1. Create the 'package.json' file using the appropriate command.  Then install the following
   packages:

   express 4.18.2
   nodemon (install as a dev dependecy because only needed for development and testing)
   mongoose 7.0.3
  
   Now, create an Express app that listens on Port 5001.  Configure 'package.json' to use the
   ES6 imports, and enable the ability to use 'npm run dev' to start the server.



2. Log 'Server started on PORT: 5001' to the console when starting the server.  Do this by way
   of a 'GET' route '/api/notes'.  Configure your own message to send to the browser to verify
   that you've gotten the server started.
