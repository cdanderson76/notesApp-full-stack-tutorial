NoteDetailPage 3


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Finish the 'handleDelete' function.  Use the built-in confirmation window to verify
   deletion.  Use the built in window system to send a message that the note was deleted.
   Ensure that this functionality takes place and test it out, and make sure that
   when a note is deleted that the screen navigates back to the home screen.


2. Finish the 'handleSave' function. If there isn't a note title (account for any empty
   characters as well), OR if there isn't note content (account for any dead space here
   as well), send an error alert to the console saying 'Please add a 'title' or 'content'.

   When updating the note in question, use a 'try/catch/finally' statement.


3. Modify the event listeners, and make sure that after the successful update message is
   sent, to automatically navigate back to the home page.


THE APP IS NOW COMPLETED!!
