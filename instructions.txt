UPDATE NOTE

NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. Complete the 'updateNote' function by using the appropriate method.

   if successful: return code 200, and 'Note updated successfully' message
   if fails: log 'Error in updateNote controller'
   if fails: create 'Internal server error message' (error 500);

   Account for it the 'ID' for the note is not found/doesn't exist.  Use the
   message 'Note not found' (404).


2. On the completed functions, ensure all responses ('res') are returned


3. Ensure that when updated, that you get the new note with the updated fields.
   Test this out in Postman.
