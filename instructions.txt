FORM FUNCTIONALITY


NOTE: .env FILE INFORMATION HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR THIS CHALLENGE!


1. In 'CreatePage.jsx', set up the form functionality.

2. Ensure that the 'Create Note' button is disabled if the form is in a 'loading' state
   Also, make sure that the button says 'Creating...' when in a loading state, and
   'Create Note' when it ISN'T in a loading state.

   Test out this functionality


3. Log the form contents to the console.  Once you know that you are getting the data,
   write a conditional to allow submission IF there is data.  Ensure that you account
   for any empty values like 'spaces'

   Also, ensure all that all form inputs are required.


4. Turn the 'handleSubmit' function into an 'async' function.  Create a 'try/catch' 
   to send messages of successful creation, or an error.  Use axios to assist in this.

   Whenever a note is successfully created, have the page navigate back to 'HomePage.jsx'


5. Create '/lib/axios.js', and create an 'axios' instance to where you will store the
   baseURL for the 'CreatePage.jsx' and the 'HomePage.jsx'.

   Remove the 'axios' imports where they are not needed.
